![Kasparov vs Deep Blue](origin.jpg){width=80%}


The year is 1997. A chess match is underway between the reigning world champion of the past 15 years, Garry Kasparov, and the underdog challenger, IBM’s Deep Blue. A year earlier, the same matchup had taken place and ended in a clear victory for Kasparov.  Now, in New York for a rematch only a year later, many were wondering what could possibly have changed in such a short amount of time. It was hard to believe that a computer could possibly outplay the greatest chess player of all time.

With a score of 2.5–2.5, the final game was underway. For the deciding match, Kasparov chose the Caro-Kann Defense, a chess opening with lines he knew inside and out. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, Deep Blue made a knight sacrifice that completely blew open the game, leading to Kasparov’s resignation in less than twenty moves. A record was set, and the crowd was shocked. For the first time in human history, a machine became the undisputed chess champion. As many felt at the time, this marked a deep shift in scientific understanding. The broader public now had to face the fact that we had built artificial intelligence that could surpass even the best of us.
This match remains as one of the most symbolically significant events in chess and data science history. It signaled that artificial intelligence was able to rival human intelligence and was capable of defeat humanity’s best player. 

Now, almost 30 years later, chess and data science tell a very different story. In 1924, the world chess governing body FIDE was founded, and with it came a standardized way of comparing player skill. Each chess player has an associated score called their “Elo.” A player’s Elo rises or falls based on how many games they win and lose. Typical grandmasters—players at the very top of the game—have Elo ratings around 2500–2600. Magnus Carlsen, whom many consider the greatest player of all time, peaked at an Elo of 2882. Stockfish, a free and open-source chess engine and the focus of this discussion has an Elo of 3645. This far surpasses any human capability. As Carlsen himself put it, “I have no chance against my phone.”

Since machines have surpassed human ability, the fundamental rules of the game have changed. In the past, if a game went on long enough (four hours or more), it could be continued the following day. Now, with chess engines able to find optimal moves from any position, modern games must be finished within a single sitting. In fact, within such a short time AI has improved at such an exponential rate that a match between Stockfish and Magnus Carlsen would not even be entertaining to watch. How did this happen, and what machine learning techniques have enabled machines to surpass the greatest intellectual champions humanity has to offer?


## The Beginning

Our journey begins with Deep Blue. Before defeating Garry Kasparov in 1997, Deep Blue started off as a custom IBM supercomputer designed by computer scientist Feng-hsiung Hsu. For a long time, chess was considered as an ideal test for the rivalry between artificial intelligence and the human mind. Unlike modern chess engines that utilize reinforcement learning techniques, the creators of Deep Blue did not rely on the ML techniques we have today. Instead, it used a pure brute force approach (IBM). Deep Blue did not learn the best moves in within a given position, instead, Deep Blue would systematically examine a vast number of possible moves and counter moves up to a certain dept. As you can imagine, this required enormous computational power. Even with over 30 processors working in parallel, Deep Blue took an average of 15 minutes to calculate a move. By comparison, modern engines can find the best move within milliseconds.

## Modern Engines

Chess engines and the field of machine learning as a whole has made huge advances since the 1990s. The main technologies behind modern chess engines are neural networks (NNs) and reinforcement learning (RL). You can think of a neural network as the brain of a machine. Data scientists train this brain by feeding it large amounts of data, allowing it to find patterns using interconnected “neurons.” Once it has learned these patterns, it can make predictions on new data. In general, the more high-quality data it receives, the better it performs.
 Reinforcement learning works by rewarding the neural network for making good decisions and penalizing it for bad ones. It is similar training a dog: good behavior earns a treat, while bad behavior does not. In machine learning, these “treats” are 1’s and 0’s which encourage our NN into making better decisions.

Together, NNs and RL give modern engines like AlphaZero and Stockfish a kind of “machine ‘s intuition” (EmergentMind). Instead of exhaustively calculating every possible move, these engines utilize their training to quickly find strong moves in any position. This kind of performance is only capable through feeding the engines millions of sample chess games. Deep Blue, although impressive for its time, was essentially a massive supercomputer that relied on raw calculation and had to be physically drag around to play a game of chess. In contrast, modern ML techniques enable impossibly complex NNs to be accessible by anyone, and on demand, far surpassing any human capabilities.
Conclusion

## Conclusion

There arrival of Neural networks and reinforcement learning have transformed the game of chess. Before chess engines, grandmasters would gather during tournaments to debate what the best move in a position might be. These discussions were always speculative, no one could ever be certain. That has changed. With modern engines, we can now determine the optimal move for a given position with absolute certainty. Although training these systems is complex and time-consuming, once trained they are capable computing optimal moves almost instantly. By harnessing modern ML techniques, we have built AI that far surpasses any human capability. Chess will never be the same—and neither will the rest of the world.
